- if recipe deleted out of order pages will stop flipping
    ex: let X be deleted     1 2 3 4 X 6 7 8
        pages will not go past 4 until a 5th page is added.

        Is there a find next object method to use instead of recipe id?
        Way to renumber all recipe_id fields on delete?


- spam clicking page forward causes a skip to blank page (stuck on blank page)
    *** Made smoother - no longer reloads on click if last page. Less prone to error but can still get stuck. ***
